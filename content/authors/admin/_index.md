Devansh is a second year PhD student in Computational and Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University and is advised by Professor Marco Pavone and Professor Yinyu Ye. Prior to joining Stanford, he received his BS in Civil and Environmental Engineering and BA in Applied Mathematics with highest distinction from University of California Berkeley. His current work is focused on the development of incentive schemes to enable the smooth uptake of socially aware traffic routing strategies and market mechanisms to ensure the efficient allocation of public goods in a pandemic environment. His research interests more broadly span algorithmic game theory, market design and optimization.
